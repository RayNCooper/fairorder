# TODOS

## Deferred from Canteen Operator Expansion (2026-03-23)

- [ ] **Real-time menu updates** — WebSocket push when menu items change (currently relies on page refresh)
- [ ] **Multi-language menus** — Currently German only; i18n for menu display
- [ ] **Recurring subscription payments** — Employee meal plans, prepaid credits (currently one-time prepayment per order only)
- [ ] **PDF menu extraction** — Accept PDF uploads for AI menu extraction (currently image-only; Gemini can handle images)
- [ ] **Headless browser crawling** — Playwright-based crawler for JS-rendered menu pages (currently cheerio for static HTML only; suggest image upload for JS-heavy sites)
- [ ] **Payment refund API** — Programmatic refunds via Stripe API (currently manual via Stripe dashboard)
- [ ] **Menu item nutritional AI analysis** — Use Gemini to estimate calories/macros from item names/descriptions
- [ ] **Automated menu scraping on schedule** — Cron-based re-crawl of online menus to keep items up to date (currently one-shot import only)
- [ ] **Baseline existing databases for Prisma migrations** — Databases created before the migration system (via `db push`) need `prisma migrate resolve --applied 0_init` before they can run new migrations. Add a setup script or document the upgrade path for existing installations.
